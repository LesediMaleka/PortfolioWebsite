  <p class="AboutMeContent">
    ADA, named after Ada Lovelace (the first female coder), is a non-profit programme which aims to educate young women of colour to become Front-End Developers and join the tech industry. ADA provides an immersive, mentored, fully-funded web development education to young, African, women.
  </p>

  

  <p class="AboutMeContent">
    ADA's mission is to <strong>empower</strong>. They give young, African women the tools and confidence to become successful game-changers in the field of technology by providing them with immersive, mentored, fully-funded Front-End Development education.

  <h2>How was I selected</h2>



  <div class="text-center hide-on-desktop">
  <p class="AboutMeContent">
    The African Developers Academy had limited capacity in its first ever year, and so had to be rigorous in their testing and eventual selection of the student body of 2019/2020. This meant that students had to apply first through Harambe, where they completed a series of aptitude tests to make sure that they had what it takes to be a web developer.
    </p>

    <p class="AboutMeContent">
      There were 500 applications, 100 selected candidates through Harambe and only 12 spots. This means that only 2% of applicants would make it through.
  </p>

  <p class="AboutMeContent">
    All of the 100 selected candidates were invited to take part in challenges hosted by ADA which put them to the test - checking for resilience, strength of character, attitude and of course ability. The women who made it through proved themselves in many ways, and continued to do so throughout their studies.

  <!-- My journey at Ada -->
  <div class="text-center hide-on-desktop">
    <h2>My coding journey</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text-center hide-on-desktop">
      <p class="AboutMeContent">I made contact with Harambee for help in seeking employment.They are an organisation committed to help young people to realise their dreams. After some skills assessments, I received a text message to come to their offices in Johannesburg, CBD. After listening to a motivational talk on the day, I proceeded to do some tests in the computer room. After that test, I was asked if I would like to take part in the maths and physics tests. 
            
        </p>
    
        <p class="AboutMeContent">I was called in a few times to write more tests. The wait during the unemployment phase felt like a lifetime. Later I was invited to attend a game day at the African Developers Academy hosted by Jozi Hub. They used the games to evaluate if I had certain skills such as being a team player, social and creative skills, and general engagement. After this, I again had to do more testing and I was invited to a bootcamp; I was one of 30 out of 100 people that were selected.

  <div class="text-center hide-on-desktop">
  

  <p class="AboutMeContent">Next, we moved on to Turtle Academy and did some exercises to determine if we possessed problem solving skills, and the willingness to learn. I was one of the final 12 that was chosen for the learnership program at the African Developers Academy. It is here where I had the opportunity to learn about programming for the first time. 
        
  </p>

  <p class="AboutMeContent">First we learned HTML. I had never coded before and my mind was blown! At times I felt overwhelmed and experienced information overload. I developed processes that worked for me during this learning phase, and I began to understand things better. For instance, I took manual notes and asked many clarity seeking questions.  After about two weeks I got the hang of it. The more I practiced, the easier it became, and I started enjoying the experience. 
        
  </p>

  <p class="AboutMeContent">Shortly after this, we learned to style websites and make them responsive with CSS. This was when I saw the potential of web designing and really fell in love with making beautiful user experiences. …My best part was when I learnt the aspect of animation within CSS. I was fascinated by the things I was able to do with animation.
          
  </p>

  <p class="AboutMeContent">Finally we honed in on JavaScript. This was the most I’d been pushed since trigonometry in high school, but I learned to love the challenge and I grew from the experience. …It was by far the most challenging programming language, but the most rewarding experience. My knowledge of user interface and functionality improved in leaps and bounds. I learnt other skills which enabled me to simplify processes and still achieve desirable results.
          
  </p>

  <p class="AboutMeContent">My last few months at ADA was when the CoronaVirus was announced as a worldwide pandemic. This meant that we couldn’t come into class for a whole semester and we missed out on the valuable experience of a 2 month internship. I spent every day in lockdown learning on my phone through platforms such as Free-Code Camp. 
          
  </p>

  <p class="AboutMeContent">Where to from here? ...My next move is to get involved in more programming projects. Hopefully get an opportunity to learn Back-End Development, and become a brilliant Full-Stack Developer. I would like to share my skills by teaching the young ones the art of coding.
